# Time-difference-project
Python project that calculates the time difference of cities around the world to South Africa

This project works very similar to the shortest distance project, since it too uses a client-server modal.
The client sends the server the date and time of the meeting(in a city) and the server responds with a response that gives that date and time in South African Standard Time(SAST)
